## About The Project

This Python code summarises results from a given set of JSON output files produced by AntiSMASH. 

The output Excel file has 2 sheets: Sheet 1 tabulates the genome name, cluster type (e.g., terpene, RiPP-like) and count of each cluster type. Sheet 2 tabulates all the identified biosynthetic gene clusters which have a match in the MiBiG database.

**Note:** This code is compatible with output files produced by AntiSMASH 7.0.
